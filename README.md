**Knowledge Graph Creation and Querying with Open-Source LLMs** 

This project demonstrates how to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a knowledge graph and query it using natural language. 

It utilizes various open-source LLM models, including Gemini Pro, LLaMA, GEMMA, and Mistral, and employs Neo4j as the Graph Database (DB). 

The project also provides insights into how natural language SQL queries are generated through prompting and compares the performance of different LLMs.


**Features**
Knowledge Graph Creation: Build a knowledge graph from structured or unstructured data using LLMs.

Natural Language Querying: Query the knowledge graph using natural language, with automatic translation to Cypher (SQL for graphs) using LLMs.

Open-Source LLM Models: Demonstrates the use of various open-source models, including Gemini Pro, LLaMA, GEMMA, and Mistral.

Neo4j Integration: Uses Neo4j as the backend Graph Database for storing and querying the knowledge graph.

Performance Comparison: Compares the accuracy of different LLM models in generating and querying the knowledge graph.
